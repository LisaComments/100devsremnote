What Are HTML & CSS?
    HTML↔gives content structure, AKA meaning to it
    CSS↔styles appearance of content
    Understanding Common HTML Terms
        Elements↔designators that define stuff inside a page
            ex: different levels of headings like <h1> through <h6>, paragraphs like <p> 
            how are elements defined?→with < > 
        Tags↔refers to <...> that surrounds the element inside
            ex: opening tags such as <div> 
            ex: closing tags have a "/" 
        Attributes↔properties used to provide more info about an element
            when are attributes usually defined?→within the opening tag, after an element's name
            generally include a name and value, in which they're followed by an "=" and are quoted
            ex: an <a> element would have an href attribute and look like: 
            <a href="http://shayhowe.com/">Shay Howe</a> 
            https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/b4iB6aq8abUruVlQa_RTqHhmzHoCrHMoFNShGFJntojIAX3s2Ne0OYpJ9l_zX6acTyQGwU4uiihSqtT8KcHMx5XJzziTN-HUHDo8I71yEQ9qJ3Cj455e-_mdaJK5fqzo.png 
            some common attributes: the id attribute (identifies an element), class attribute (specifies a source for embeddable content), href attribute (gives the hyperlink)
Setting Up the HTML Document Structure
    HTML documents are saved as .HTML
    <!DOCTYPE html>→declaration that tells the browsers which version of HTML is being used 
        is placed at the very beginning of the document
        <html>→follows the document declaration, and signifies the beginning of the document
            <head>→identifies top of the document, like any metadata (info about the web page)
                this info w/i <head> won't be displayed
                    <body>→is the visible content w/i a web page
    <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"> <!-- still the html tag -->
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is a web page.</p>
  </body>
</html> 
    when an element is inside of another element?↔nested element 
        ~ * self-closing elements * ~
            <br>
            <embed>
            <hr>
            <img>
            <input>
            <link>
            <meta>
            <param>
            <source>
            <wbr>
Understanding Common CSS Terms
    Selectors↔assigns which element(s) inside the HTML to target and apply style
        ex: color, size, position
        with selectors, you can apply them to one element or several 
        typically targets attribute values (id or class value) or targets the type of element (<h1>, <p>)
            selectors are usually followed by { }  p {...}
    Properties↔applies a style, after selected
        property falls after the selector inside { } and then a :
        properties can be background, color, font-size, height, and width  p {
 	color: ...;
 	font-size: ...;
 }
    Values↔determines the behavior of that property and sits between the : and ;
        p {
	color: orange;
	font-size: 16px;
}

Marking Main Area of a Webpage
    what is the main element?→surrounds content for the page's central topic

Working with Selectors
    Class Selectors↔selects an element based on the element's class attribute value
        these select a particular group of elements rather than all elements of one type and is a little more specific than class selectors
        helps us to apply same styles to different elements by using the same class attribute value across multiple elements
        in CSS, they're leaded with an "."
            .awesome {...}  <div class="awesome">...</div>
 <p class="awesome">...</p>
    ID Selectors↔more precise than class selectors and targets only one unique element at a time
        uses id attribute value as a selector
        can only be used once per page
        inside CSS, they're referred to with an "#" followed by the id attribute value
        #shayhowe {...} <div id="shayhowe">...</div>
Type Selectors↔target elements by their element type
    ex: to target all division elements, <div>, we use a type selector of div  div {...}<div>...</div>
<div>...</div> 
Referencing CSS   #[[Referencing Css]]  #[[Linking to an Email Address]] 
    must reference the CSS inside the HTML file
        referenced w/i the <head> element of our HTML document
        usually the CSS file name sits inside a <link> element w/i the <head> elemental unit
        <head>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
	<!-- the "rel" attribute WITH the value "stylesheet" specifices their relationship -->
</head> 
    if our CSS file happens to be in another folder, the href attribute value needs to correlate to this path for ex: main.css file was stored in a subdirectory named stylesheets, then the href attribute value would look like "stylesheets/main.css". the / indicates that it's mobing into a subdirectory or folder 
Using CSS Resets
    CSS resets take every common HTML element with a predefined style and provide one unified style for all browsers.
