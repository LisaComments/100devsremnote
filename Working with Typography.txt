Adding Color to Text
    How would we set the color of text?→using the color property
        What kind of values does the color property possess?→rgb, hex, HSL, keywords
        example of changing color of all text within HTM: document: 
        html {
    color: #555;
} 
Changing Font Properties
    CSS has two main property categories: font-based and text-based
    Font Family
        font-family property is for declaring what kind of font you’re using
        it includes fallback or substitute font
        the first declared font is the primary font shown
        alternative fonts are written from left to right in this property
        font names with two or more words should be written within commas
        the last font should be a system default font, like serif or sans-serif
        body {
  font-family: "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
    Font Size
        font-size property allows you to set the size of the text with pixels, percentages, em, or points
        body {
  font-size: 14px;
}
    Font Style
        font-style can bell prevent text from becoming italic or keep it italicized
        it accepts four keyword values: normal, italic, oblique, inherit 
        .special {
  font-style: italic;
} 
    Font Variant
        You might want your font to be in all caps at times 
        you’d use font-variant property 
        it accepts three values: normal, small caps, inherit 
        .firm {
  font-variant: small-caps;
}
    Font Weight
        font-weight can bolden a font
        it accepts keyword or numeric values
        keyword values are: normal, bold, bolder, lighter, inherit 
        instead of using bolder or lighter, it’s recommended to use numeric values for more control
        .daring {
  font-weight: bold;
}

        the numeric values are: 100-900 and scale up from thinnest to thickest
        .daring {
  font-weight: 600;
}

    Typeface Weight
        using a weight not available for the typeface in use will cause the font to default to its closest value
        example: Times New Roman typeface comes in two weights: normal, 400 and bold, or 700. its thickest weight is 700, so if you try to use 900 it will default to 700
        Line Height
            line-height is the difference between two lines and accepts all general length values 
            ⭐️ the best practice to set line-height is to around 1 1/2 times * our font-size property. This can be quickly set by making line-height 150% or 1.5
            pixels give you more control
            body {
  line-height: 22px;
}

            line-height can vertically center a single line of text like so 
            .btn {
  height: 22px;
  line-height: 22px;
}

        Shorthand Font Properties
            all earlier font properties can be short handed into: font 
            The order of these property values should be as follows, from left to right: font-style, font-variant, font-weight, font-size, line-height, and font-family 
            the property values are listed from left to right without commas (except for font-family)
            A forward slash, /, separator is needed between the font-size and line-height property values
            all values are optional except for font-size and font-family 
            html {
  font: italic small-caps bold 14px/22px "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
        CSS Pseudo-Classes
            pseudo-classes are keywords that may be added to the end of a selector to style an element when it’s in a unique state
 Applying Text Properties  
    Text Align
        text-align property aligns text
        as five values: left, right, center, justify, inherit 
        p {
  text-align: center;
}

            
    Text Decoration
        text-decoration spruces up text
        its keyword values are none, underline, over line, line-through, inherit  
        can have many values, as long as they’re separated by commas
        .note {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
    Text Indent
        text-indent property is used for indenting the first line of text inside an element
        common length values are pixels, points, percentages, etc
        positive values indent inward, while negative values indent backward 
        p {
    text-indent: 20px;
}
    Text Shadow
        text-shadow property lets us add a shadow or multiple shadows to text
        takes on 4 values: first 3 values are lengths and the last value is a color
